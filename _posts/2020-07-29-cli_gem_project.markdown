I've just completed my first project and I wasn't really perpared for the new way that I was about to have to learn.

The journey through the beginning stages was great. I was reading the READMEs and doing the labs. There were definitely some challenges. Quite a few challenges, actually. I hit large walls where I wanted to tear my hair out because I couldn't figure out the issue. As it always does, it would turn out to be something dumb and that I would find through 20 minutes of googling. That was it's own type of learning. I would have a large structure, one provided to me by the lab. From there I just needed to move the puzzle pieces around and fit them in the right slots. But this challenge was different.

It wasn't the great frustration that I was met with when i couldn't finish a lab. That was like a wall that appeared in front of me suddenly. This challenge was more like a cloud of smoke, one that seemed impassable at first. The prospect of being out on my own all of a sudden, having to confront this seemingly insurmountable task all on my own was, daunting.

There was little structure, and little help, or that's how it seemed at first. Once I started to look deeper, I realized that it wasn't that I couldn't complete the project, it's that I just had to figure out a new way to learn. Instead of just reading the lab a few more times, or going back to the things I had done before for inspiration. I had to think critically and creatively, I had to build something that was completely mine. I had to research and find examples and delve into things I hadn't thought about before. Once I realized that it was the fear of doing something that was completely me that was holding me back, the cloud of smoke dissipated.

Don't get me wrong, there were bumps in the road, where my code didn't work, I couldn't find the right tags to scrape, and I couldn't get the files to require properly. But those were headaches I'd dealt with before, so with perserverence and a little bit of googling. I passed them with ease.

Now that I know how to handle this type of challenge, I'm more than ready for the next one.
