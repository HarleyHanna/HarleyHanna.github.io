Starting is the hardest part. The trial, lies in the beginning. With the beginning, there's no reward yet, all test, and no win. 

The ending is hard too, departure from the Journey.

But the middle, the Journey, that's where the true satisfaction, the meat of the test comes from. Trial, and reward, a cycle.

Starting coding was something difficult, and I could say it took me a long time to actually take the big step. Once I did, I was scared, and nervous. Fearful of failure and the things to come. I spent my first week quelling doubt, pushing down the waves in my mind telling me that I wasn't ready yet, and that I would fail. I looked up to the people that had made this choice that I hadn't yet. They must've been so much more intelligent than I, they must've cruised through all this with no problem. 

Two weeks in and I can easily say those waves have vanished. I now feel more self-assured and motivated than ever. Once I got past the starting, a force rose inside me, pushing forward, moving on. Determination lent itself to me, as I'm sure it has to so many other Flatiron Students. The people I've met here already seem to have trod the same path.

But, now's where the real fun comes. The Journey has arrived, and I'm ready to take the ride. As ready as I ever will be.
